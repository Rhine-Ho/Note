#About the differences of Javascript, Java, Python, C, C++

- [C](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/) & __C++__

[Tutorials.](https://www.cprogramming.com/)

(`C`: System bottom layer, driver, embedded development)
(`C++`: Game development, large-scale high-performance and distributed program development.`There are many libraries in C++, and many python libraries are written in C++`.)

Theoretically, any development can be done as long as there are appropriate hardware drivers and APIs, which is characterized by high efficiency. C/C++ is basically the most efficient compiled language. 

Unless your system doesn't even have C/C++ compiler. Some systems don't have C++ compiler, but C generally does. At present, C language is mainly used to develop low-level modules (such as drivers, decoders, algorithm implementation), service applications (such as web servers) and embedded applications (such as programs in microwave ovens). C++ can also do these, but due to the complexity and standard problems of C++ People still prefer to use C. C++ is more suitable for complex but highly efficient facilities, such as large games, some basic libraries and large desktop applications.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/about/)

Python is doing server development and Internet of Things development. Information security, big data processing, data visualization machine learning, Internet of Things development, APIs of major software and desktop applications all need python.

Python is also called "glue language" because of it's rich and powerful libraries. It can easily connect various modules made in other languages (especially C/C++).

A common application scenario is to use Python to quickly generate the prototype of a program (sometimes even the final interface of the program), and then rewrite the parts with special requirements in a more appropriate language, such as the graphics rendering module in 3D games. If the performance requirements are particularly high, it can be rewritten in C/C++ and then encapsulated into an extended class library that Python can call.

- [Java](https://blog.udemy.com/learn-java/)

[Tutorials.](https://www.learnjavaonline.org/)

Java is an open-source programming language and computing platform that was initially released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems. Oracle has released versions regularly since 2009.

It is a general-purpose language. That means you can use it for many types of applications, including web apps, Android applications, web servers, web services, desktop software, video games, and more. Developers also use it in embedded systems like televisions, game consoles, and other hardware.
