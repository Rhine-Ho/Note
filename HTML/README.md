 Structuring the web with HTML</h1>
 <h3 align="start">About HTML（HyperText Markup Languag）:<br>is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.<br>HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as <br>a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.</h3>

## HTML Syntax

* < >...</ > -This things are called tags,they describe what kind of visual element this is,
so in this example we are creating a button.

```html
    <button>Press me</button>
```

 This tag represents the start of a button,and we have a slash in the second tag it means it's the end of the button.

 And whatever is in between is the contents of the button otherwise the label that's in the button.

```html
<!Doctype html>
<html>
<!-- this document contains the html code.-->
<head>
...
<!-- this section has information about the page,but doesn't necessarily have things that show up on the page.-->
</head>

<body>
...
<!--here is everything that's visual that you can see on the web page.-->
</body>

</html>

```

#When we write html, here's usually a very specific structure that our page has to follow.
- HTML tag inside an HTML tag call Nesting.
