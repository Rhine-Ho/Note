# Design Document
This file should discuss how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did, both technical and ethical. Your design document as a whole should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your README.md is meant to be a userâ€™s manual, consider your DESIGN.md your opportunity to give the staff a tour of your project underneath its hood.

## Technical Decisions
### In this section, share and justify the technical decisions you made.
You don't need to respond to all questions, but you might find some of the following helpful:
* What design challenge(s) did you run into while completing your project? How did you choose to address them and why?
* Was there a feature in your project you could have implemented in multiple ways? Which way did you choose, and why?
* If you used a new technology, what did you learn about this new technology? Did this technology prove to be the right tool?



## Ethical Decisions
### What motivated you to complete this project? What features did you want to create and why?



### Who are the intended users of your project? What do they want, need, or value?
You should consider your project's users to be those who interact _directly_ with your project, as well as those who might interact with it _indirectly_, through others' use of your project.



### How does your project's impact on users change as the project scales up? 
You might choose one of the following questions to reflect on:
* How could one of your project's features be misused?
* Are there any types of users who might have difficulty using your project?
* If your project becomes widely adopted, are there social concerns you might anticipate?
