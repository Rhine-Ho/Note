- HTML is use to create visual element on a web page, the language that gives web content structure and meaning,
whether that's a button,a text or an image, and we call this process rendering.
So,html is used to render visuals.

 
- CSS, the language used to style web pages

- JavaScript is used to manage information, the scripting language used to create dynamic functionality on the web.
The thing to note is that we can't load JavaScript directly in a web page.
JavaScript has to be loaded within html.
